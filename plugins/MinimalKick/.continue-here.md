# Resume Point

## Current State: Stage 0 - Research Complete

DSP architecture documented. Ready to proceed to planning.

## Completed So Far

**Stage 0:** ✓ Complete
- Plugin type defined: Synth (monophonic kick drum)
- Professional examples researched: Sonic Academy Kick 2, Roland TR-808, Roland TR-909
- JUCE modules identified: juce::dsp::Oscillator, juce::ADSR, juce::MidiMessage
- DSP feasibility verified: All components implementable with JUCE
- Parameter ranges researched: All 5 parameters validated
- Complexity tier: Tier 4 (MODERATE, 20-minute research depth)
- Features researched: 6 features (Oscillator, Pitch Envelope, Amplitude Envelope, Saturation, MIDI, Voice Management)

## Next Steps

1. Stage 1: Planning (calculate complexity, create implementation plan)
2. Review architecture.md findings
3. Pause here for user decision
