# Resume Point

## Current State: UI Mockup v1 Created

UI mockup v1 has been generated and committed. Design iteration in progress.

## Completed So Far

**Stage 0 - Planning & Design:** In Progress
- Creative brief: ✓ Complete
- UI mockup v1: ✓ Complete (1000×500px, 6 horizontal channel strips)
- Parameter specification: Pending
- Architecture document: Pending
- Implementation plan: Pending

**Design Details:**
- Layout: 6 equal-width vertical channel strips (Kick, Low Tom, Mid Tom, Clap, Closed Hat, Open Hat)
- Controls: 24 parameters total (4 per drum voice: LEVEL, TONE, DECAY/SNAP, TUNING)
- Visual style: Authentic 808 aesthetic (brushed metal, dark knobs, red/orange LEDs)
- Window size: 1000×500px (fixed, non-resizable)
- LED indicators for each drum voice (trigger visualization)

## Next Steps

1. Iterate on mockup design (create v2 with refinements)
2. Finalize mockup and proceed to parameter specification
3. View mockup in browser (already opened automatically)
4. Other

## Context to Preserve

**Key Decisions:**
- Plugin type: Synth (Drum Instrument)
- Core concept: Authentic 808 emulation with circuit-accurate synthesis, MIDI triggering, individual outputs, velocity sensitivity, per-drum tuning
- Voices: Kick (bridged-T oscillator), Low Tom (bridged-T), Mid Tom (bridged-T), Clap (filtered noise, multi-trigger), Closed Hat (six-oscillator metallic), Open Hat (six-oscillator metallic)
- MIDI mapping: GM drum standard (C1=kick, D1=clap, F1=low tom, A1=mid tom, F#1=closed hat, A#1=open hat)

**Files Created:**
