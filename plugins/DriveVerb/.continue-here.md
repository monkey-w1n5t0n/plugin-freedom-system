# Resume Point

## Current State: Stage 2 Complete - Foundation Established

Build system created and compilation verified. CMakeLists.txt configured with JUCE 8, WebView support enabled, minimal PluginProcessor and PluginEditor classes created. Plugin compiles successfully (VST3, AU, Standalone). Ready to proceed to Stage 3 (Shell).

## Completed So Far

**Stage 0:** ✓ Complete
- Plugin type: Audio Effect (Reverb)
- Professional examples researched (Valhalla Room, FabFilter Pro-R, UAD Galaxy Tape Echo)
- JUCE modules identified: `dsp::Reverb`, `dsp::IIR::Filter`, `dsp::WaveShaper`, `dsp::DryWetMixer`
- DSP architecture specification created (`architecture.md`)
- Parameter ranges validated against industry standards

**Stage 1:** ✓ Complete
- Complexity score calculated: 5.0 / 5.0 (maximum complexity)
- Strategy: Phased implementation (4 DSP phases + 3 GUI phases)
- Implementation plan created (`plan.md`)
- Estimated duration: ~2.5 hours total

**Stage 2:** ✓ Complete
- Build system created with JUCE 8 configuration
- CMakeLists.txt: WebView support enabled (NEEDS_WEB_BROWSER TRUE, juce_gui_extra linked)
- Minimal PluginProcessor and PluginEditor classes created
- Effect bus configuration (.withInput + .withOutput)
- Compilation verified (VST3, AU, Standalone) - 17s build time
- juce_generate_juce_header() correctly placed

## Next Steps

1. Stage 3: Shell (implement APVTS with all 6 parameters)
2. Stage 4: DSP Implementation (4 phases: reverb → drive → filter → routing)
3. Stage 5: GUI Integration (3 phases: layout → toggle/meter → polish)
4. Stage 6: Validation (presets, pluginval, CHANGELOG)

## Context to Preserve

**Plugin Type:** Audio Effect (Reverb)

**Processing:** Algorithmic reverb with tape saturation (wet only) and DJ-style filter

**JUCE Modules:**
- `juce::dsp::Reverb` - Algorithmic reverb engine
- `juce::dsp::IIR::Filter<float>` - DJ-style filter (low-pass/high-pass with center bypass)
- `juce::dsp::WaveShaper<float>` - Drive saturation (tanh transfer function)
- `juce::dsp::DryWetMixer<float>` - Equal-power dry/wet blending

**Signal Flow:**
- PRE mode: Input → Reverb → Filter → Drive → Dry/Wet Mix → Output
- POST mode: Input → Reverb → Drive → Filter → Dry/Wet Mix → Output

**Key Technical Decisions:**
- Reverb: `juce::dsp::Reverb` sufficient for v1 (consider custom FDN in v2)
- Filter: `dsp::IIR::Filter` with Butterworth coefficients (Q=0.707)
- Drive: `tanh()` waveshaping for even harmonics (tape-like saturation)
- Routing: Conditional branching for PRE/POST switching (efficient)

**Complexity Breakdown:**
- Parameters: 6 (1.2 points)
- Algorithms: 4 JUCE DSP components (4.0 points)
- Features: 0 (0 points)
- Total: 5.2 → capped at 5.0

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Stage 4.1: Core reverb + dry/wet mixing (30 min)
- Stage 4.2: Drive saturation (20 min)
- Stage 4.3: DJ-style filter (25 min)
- Stage 4.4: PRE/POST routing (15 min)
- Stage 5.1: WebView layout + basic knobs (30 min)
- Stage 5.2: Toggle switch + VU meter (20 min)
- Stage 5.3: Polish + parameter displays (15 min)

**Files Created:**
- `plugins/DriveVerb/.ideas/architecture.md` (DSP specification contract)
- `plugins/DriveVerb/.ideas/plan.md` (Implementation plan with phase breakdown)
