# Resume Point

## Current State: Stage 0 - Research Complete

Research phase complete. DSP architecture documented with JUCE module selections, processing chain, and algorithm specifications. Ready to proceed to planning.

## Completed So Far

**Stage 0:** ✓ Complete
- Plugin type defined: Audio Effect (Tape Saturator)
- Professional examples researched: Waves J37, UAD Studer A800, UAD Ampex ATR-102, FabFilter Saturn 2, Valhalla Delay
- DSP feasibility verified: JUCE modules identified for all components
- Parameter ranges researched: Industry-standard tape emulation controls
- JUCE modules identified:
  - juce::dsp::Oversampling (2x, FIR filters)
  - juce::dsp::WaveShaper (custom tanh transfer function)
  - juce::DelayLine with Lagrange3rd interpolation (wow/flutter)
  - juce::dsp::DryWetMixer (equal-power crossfade)
  - Custom dropout generator and subtle tape noise

## Next Steps

1. Stage 1: Planning (calculate complexity, create implementation plan)
2. Review research findings
3. Pause here

## Context to Preserve

**Plugin Type:** Audio Effect (Tape Saturator)
**Processing:** Time-domain saturation with pitch modulation, stereo processing
**Core DSP Chain:** Input → Oversampling (2x) → Saturation → Downsample → Wow/Flutter → Dropout → Noise → Dry/Wet Mix → Output
**Complexity Estimate:** Moderate (custom DSP for wow/flutter and dropout, but well-defined algorithms)

**Files Created:**
- plugins/TapeAge/.ideas/architecture.md (DSP specification with 6 core components)

**Key Design Decisions:**
- 2x oversampling for clean saturation (aliasing reduction)
- Delay line approach for wow/flutter (authentic tape speed variation)
- Subtle noise implementation (age controls texture, not overwhelming hiss)
- Equal-power dry/wet mixing (no center-dip volume loss)
