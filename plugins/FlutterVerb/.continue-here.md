# Resume Point

## Current State: Stage 0 - Research Complete

Research phase complete. DSP architecture documented with all JUCE modules identified and signal flow defined. Ready to proceed to planning.

## Completed So Far

**Stage 0:** ✓ Complete
- Plugin type defined: Audio Effect (Reverb)
- Professional examples researched (Soundtoys Little Plate, UAD Pure Plate, Valhalla Plate, LiquidSonics Lustrous Plates)
- DSP feasibility verified: All components implementable with JUCE
- Parameter ranges researched: Industry-standard reverb ranges documented
- JUCE modules identified: dsp::Reverb, DelayLine, IIR::Filter, DryWetMixer
- Codebase references analyzed: TapeAge (saturation, wow/flutter), GainKnob (DJ filter)
- DSP architecture created: 7 core components, complete signal flow diagram

## Next Steps

1. Stage 1: Planning (calculate complexity, create implementation plan)
2. Review research findings in architecture.md
3. Pause here

## Context to Preserve

**Plugin Type:** Audio Effect (Reverb)
**Processing:** Plate reverb → Wow/Flutter modulation → Tape saturation → DJ filter → Dry/wet mix
**JUCE Modules:**
- juce::dsp::Reverb (plate algorithm)
- juce::dsp::DelayLine with Lagrange3rd interpolation (pitch modulation)
- Custom LFOs (wow: 0.5-1.5Hz, flutter: 4-8Hz)
- Custom tanh waveshaper (tape saturation)
- juce::dsp::IIR::Filter (DJ-style LP/HP)
- juce::dsp::DryWetMixer (dry/wet blend)

**Complexity Estimate:** High (5.0) - Dual LFO modulation, reverb tuning, MOD_MODE routing
