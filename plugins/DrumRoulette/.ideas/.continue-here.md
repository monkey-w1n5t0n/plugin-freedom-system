# Workflow State: DrumRoulette

**Status:** 🚧 Stage 2 Complete (Foundation)
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-12
**Next Action:** Continue to Stage 3 (Shell - implement 73 parameters)

---

## Stage 0: Research - COMPLETED

**Completed:** 2025-11-12

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ DSP architecture specification created (architecture.md)
- ✅ Researched JUCE sample playback, envelopes, filters, pitch shifting
- ✅ Studied professional samplers (Battery 4, Geist2, Kontakt)

---

## Stage 1: Planning - COMPLETED

**Completed:** 2025-11-12

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ Complexity score calculated: 5.0 / 5.0 (maximum complexity)
- ✅ Implementation plan created (plan.md)
- ✅ Phase breakdown defined (4 DSP phases + 3 GUI phases)

**Complexity Breakdown:**
- Parameters: 73 → 2.0 points (capped)
- Algorithms: 8 DSP components → 8 points
- Features: ADSR envelopes + MIDI control → 2 points
- Total: 12.0 → 5.0 (capped at maximum)

**Strategy:** Phase-based implementation
- Stage 4: 4 phases (Voice architecture → Envelope/pitch → Filtering/volume → Randomization/solo-mute)
- Stage 5: 3 phases (Layout → Parameter binding → LED indicators)
- Estimated duration: ~4 hours 30 minutes

---

## Stage 2: Foundation - COMPLETED

**Completed:** 2025-11-12

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ CMakeLists.txt created (JUCE 8, Instrument type, 1400×950px window)
- ✅ PluginProcessor.h/cpp created (pass-through implementation)
- ✅ PluginEditor.h/cpp created (placeholder UI)
- ✅ Build verified (VST3, AU, Standalone compile successfully)

**Build Status:** Compiles without errors (54s build time)

---

## Ready for Stage 3

**All contracts complete:**
- ✅ creative-brief.md
- ✅ parameter-spec.md (73 parameters)
- ✅ architecture.md (8 DSP components)
- ✅ plan.md (5.0 complexity, phased strategy)

**To proceed:**
Run `/continue DrumRoulette` to begin Stage 3 (Shell - implement APVTS with 73 parameters)
