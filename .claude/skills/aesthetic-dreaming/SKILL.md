# aesthetic-dreaming Skill

**Purpose:** Create aesthetic templates before implementing any plugins. Capture visual design systems through adaptive questioning, generate structured aesthetic.md, and optionally create test previews demonstrating the aesthetic across different plugin types.

**Solves:** The friction of needing to create a full plugin just to design and save an aesthetic template. Build a library of visual design systems first, apply them later.

---

<workflow_overview>
<critical_sequence enforcement="strict">
This workflow MUST execute phases in order. Do NOT skip phases or proceed to finalization before completing gap analysis and question batches.

**Phase Flow:**
1. **Phase 1: Free-form collection** - Gather initial aesthetic vision
2. **Phase 2: Gap analysis** - Identify missing visual elements
3. **Phase 3: Question batch** - Ask 4 contextual questions via AskUserQuestion
4. **Phase 3.5: Decision gate** - Finalize / Continue / Add context
5. **Phase 3.7: Name aesthetic** (if finalizing)
6. **Phase 4: Test preview selection**
7. **Phase 5: Generate files**
8. **Phase 6: Decision menu**

**Loop Structure:**
Phases 2-3-3.5 repeat until user chooses "finalize" at decision gate.

**Critical Rules:**
- Do NOT skip phases
- Do NOT execute phases out of order
- Do NOT proceed to finalization before decision gate approval
- NEVER auto-proceed past decision gates
</critical_sequence>

<phase id="1" name="free_form_collection">
<instructions>
Present open invitation to user. Extract all mentioned visual concepts verbatim and accumulate in context.
</instructions>

<required_prompt>
What aesthetic are you envisioning?

Describe the visual design system you want to create—share as much or as little as you want. I'll ask follow-ups for anything missing.

Consider: overall vibe, color palette, control styling, spacing, textures, typography, and plugin types this would suit.

You can reference existing designs, describe feelings, or provide technical specifics.
</required_prompt>

<extraction_targets>
- Visual Identity: Overall vibe, mood, design philosophy
- Color System: Palette, warm/cool, contrast, specific colors
- Typography: Font choices, sizing philosophy
- Control Styling: Knobs, sliders, buttons, rotaries
- Spacing: Density, breathing room, layout approach
- Surface Treatment: Textures, shadows, depth, glossy vs. matte
- Details: Special features, animations, microinteractions
- Best For: Plugin types, use cases
- Inspirations: References to existing designs
</extraction_targets>

<state_requirement>
MUST accumulate all extracted concepts in persistent context. This context carries forward through ALL phases and question batches. NEVER lose information from previous phases.
</state_requirement>
</phase>

---

<phase id="2" name="gap_analysis">
<critical_sequence>
1. Parse user's accumulated context (from Phase 1 + any previous question batches)
2. Check coverage against tier priority system
3. Identify top 4 gaps by tier priority
4. NEVER ask about already-provided information
</critical_sequence>

<tier_system>
**Tier 1 (Critical):** Overall vibe/mood, color philosophy, control style
**Tier 2 (Visual Core):** Specific colors, typography, spacing, textures, control details
**Tier 3 (Context):** Best suited for, special features, inspirations
</tier_system>

<anti_pattern>
NEVER ask redundant questions. If user stated "dark modern blue", do NOT ask:
- "What's the overall vibe?" (modern already stated)
- "Light or dark?" (dark already stated)
- "What accent color?" (blue already stated)

Instead focus on uncovered gaps: typography, spacing, textures, plugin types.
</anti_pattern>

<delegation_rule>
Detailed question banks are in references/aesthetic-questions.md. Reference for gap analysis strategies and question options.
</delegation_rule>
</phase>

<phase id="3" name="question_batch">
<instructions>
Generate exactly 4 questions using AskUserQuestion tool based on gaps identified in Phase 2.
</instructions>

<requirements>
- MUST use AskUserQuestion tool (not inline menu)
- Provide 3-4 meaningful options per question (not just open text)
- Always include "Other" option for custom input
- Users can type "skip" in "Other" to skip questions
- Questions MUST target identified gaps, prioritized by tier

  - Always include "Other" option automatically
</tool_usage>

<example>
See references/question-examples.md for detailed AskUserQuestion formatting examples and question banks by category.
</example>

<state_transition>
After receiving question batch answers:
1. Merge answers with accumulated context (cumulative, never overwrite)
2. Proceed DIRECTLY to decision gate (Phase 3.5)
3. Decision gate will route to Phase 2 (re-analyze) or Phase 3.7 (finalize)

<adaptive_questioning_strategy>
<critical_sequence>
This is the core algorithm for gap-driven questioning:

1. Extract concepts from user input (Phase 1 or additional context)
2. Check coverage against tier system (Tier 1 → Tier 2 → Tier 3)
3. Identify gaps (missing concepts by tier priority)
4. Generate 4 questions targeting highest-priority gaps (Phase 3)
5. Present decision gate (Phase 3.5)
6. IF continue THEN repeat steps 2-5 with accumulated context
7. IF finalize THEN proceed to Phase 3.7

NEVER ask about concepts already provided.
NEVER repeat questions in different words.
ALWAYS extract maximum information from each user response.
</critical_sequence>

<example>
User says: "I want a sleek, dark interface with neon blue accents and flat modern controls."

**Extraction:**
- Vibe: sleek, dark, modern
- Color: neon blue accents
- Controls: flat

**Gaps identified (by tier):**
- Typography choices? (Tier 2)
- Spacing philosophy? (Tier 2)
- Surface textures? (Tier 2)
- Best plugin types? (Tier 3)

**Generate 4 questions targeting these gaps.**
</example>

See references/aesthetic-questions.md for detailed gap analysis strategies.

## Question Generation Examples

### Example 1: Detailed Input

```
User: "I want a vintage analog aesthetic with brass knobs, warm earth tones, and a subtle paper texture. Should feel like 1960s hardware."

Extracted:
- Vibe: Vintage analog, 1960s hardware ✓
- Color philosophy: Warm earth tones ✓
- Control style: Brass knobs ✓
- Surface: Paper texture ✓
- Typography: Not mentioned ✗
- Specific colors: Earth tones (generic) ✗
- Spacing: Not mentioned ✗
- Best for: Not mentioned ✗

Gaps identified (4 needed):
- Specific earth tone colors? (Tier 2)
- Typography approach? (Tier 2)
- Spacing density? (Tier 2)
- Best suited for what plugins? (Tier 3)

Question Batch 1:
1. "What specific earth tone palette?" → [Orange/brown/cream, Brown/tan/beige, Green/olive/khaki, Other]
2. "Typography approach?" → [Technical sans-serif, Classic serif, Vintage typewriter, Other]
3. "Spacing density?" → [Tight vintage, Comfortable balanced, Generous spacious, Other]
4. "Best suited for what plugins?" → [Tape/analog effects, Vintage compressors, All warm effects, Other]
```

### Example 2: Vague Input

```
User: "A clean modern aesthetic"

Extracted:
- Vibe: Clean, modern ✓
- Everything else: Not mentioned ✗

Gaps identified (4 needed):
- Color philosophy? (Tier 1)
- Control style? (Tier 1)
- Specific colors? (Tier 2)
- Typography? (Tier 2)

Question Batch 1:
1. "Color philosophy?" → [Dark with bright accents, Light with dark accents, Monochromatic, Other]
2. "Control styling?" → [Flat 2D, Subtle 3D, Skeuomorphic, Other]
3. "Primary color?" → [Blue professional, Gray neutral, Green organic, Other]
4. "Typography approach?" → [Technical/readable, Decorative/bold, Minimal/light, Other]

[Then decision gate]

If user chooses "Ask me 4 more questions":
- User answered: "Dark with bright accents", "Flat 2D", "Blue professional", "Technical/readable"

Updated context:
- Vibe: Clean, modern ✓
- Color: Dark with blue accents ✓
- Controls: Flat 2D ✓
- Typography: Technical/readable ✓

New gaps for Batch 2:
- Specific blue shade? (Tier 2)
- Spacing preference? (Tier 2)
- Surface treatment? (Tier 2)
- Best suited for? (Tier 3)
```

## Success Criteria

Skill is successful when:
- Aesthetic concept captured through adaptive questions
- No redundant questions asked (respects already-provided info)
- aesthetic.md generated with all 12 sections filled
- Test previews generated for selected plugin types (if any)
- Files stored in correct locations (.claude/aesthetics/[id]/)
- Aesthetic immediately available in ui-mockup skill
- User feels creative flow, not interrogated
- Clear next steps presented

---

## Implementation Notes

### Why This Approach Works

**1. Adaptive questioning matches plugin-ideation pattern:**
- Free-form collection first (capture everything)
- Gap analysis identifies missing pieces
- Questions generated contextually, not from rigid script
- Decision gate allows iteration or finalization

**2. Visual design tiers make sense:**
- Tier 1 (Critical): Vibe, color philosophy, control style
- Tier 2 (Visual Core): Specific colors, typography, spacing, textures
- Tier 3 (Context): Best suited for, inspirations, special features

**3. Test previews solve the visualization problem:**
- User can see aesthetic applied to real layouts
- Multiple parameter counts demonstrate flexibility
- Optional (user can skip if they just want prose description)

**4. Integration with ui-template-library:**
- aesthetic-dreaming creates the aesthetic.md
- ui-template-library interprets and applies it
- Separation of concerns: creation vs application

### Format Consistency

**aesthetic.md structure:**
- Exactly 12 sections in fixed order
- Prose descriptions with concrete examples
- Interpretable by both humans and Claude
- Human-editable, machine-parseable

**Test previews:**
- Stored in test-previews/ subdirectory
- Named by plugin type: simple-compressor.html
- Standalone HTML files (open in browser)
- Demonstrate aesthetic across different layouts

### Quality Control

**Before saving aesthetic:**
- ✅ Verify all template sections are present
- ✅ Check for placeholder text not replaced
- ✅ Validate color codes are valid hex/rgb
- ✅ Ensure prose is descriptive (not just values)
- ✅ Confirm aesthetic ID is unique

**Before generating test previews:**
- ✅ Verify test plugin specs exist
- ✅ Check ui-template-library skill is available
- ✅ Ensure aesthetic.md is complete
- ✅ Validate output directory exists
