## Conflict Resolution Log

### Conflict 1: Stage Merging vs. Clear Separation
- **First-principles recommendation**: Merge stages 2+3 and 0+1 for efficiency (7→5 stages)
- **Clarity recommendation**: Add stage prefixes to agents for workflow visibility
- **Conflict**: Merging stages reduces clarity of workflow progression
- **Decision**: Implement BOTH - merge stages AND add stage prefixes to merged agents
- **Rationale**: Stage prefixes maintain workflow clarity even with fewer stages. Efficiency gains (43k tokens + 3 min) justify consolidation while naming preserves mental model.

### Conflict 2: Contract Immutability vs. Flexibility
- **First-principles recommendation**: Maintain immutability for predictability
- **Lateral-thinking recommendation**: Append-only evolution for discovered parameters
- **Conflict**: Philosophical - contracts as source of truth vs. practical iteration needs
- **Decision**: Maintain immutability with better escape hatch
- **Rationale**: Contract drift causes more problems than it solves. Instead, implement pause/resume workflow for manual edits when truly needed. Preserves system integrity while acknowledging real-world needs.

### Conflict 3: Skill Isolation vs. Embedded Validation
- **First-principles recommendation**: Move validation to subagent (isolation)
- **Lateral-thinking recommendation**: Embed design-sync in ui-mockup (coupling)
- **Conflict**: Architectural purity vs. practical efficiency
- **Decision**: Embed design-sync in ui-mockup, keep other validation in subagent
- **Rationale**: design-sync is ONLY called by ui-mockup (100% coupling already exists). Embedding saves 7k tokens + 30s. Other validation remains isolated for flexibility.

### Conflict 4: Express Mode vs. Safety Gates
- **First-principles recommendation**: Express mode with auto-flow
- **Clarity recommendation**: Clear checkpoint communication
- **Conflict**: Speed vs. visibility/control
- **Decision**: Implement configurable express mode with complexity detection
- **Rationale**: Simple plugins (< 10 params) default to express. Complex plugins retain gates. User can override with --express or --safe flags.

### Conflict 5: Generic vs. Specific Naming
- **Clarity recommendation**: Remove plugin-* prefix (too generic)
- **Lateral recommendation**: Use milestone language (Foundation Ready, Audio Working)
- **Conflict**: Technical accuracy vs. user understanding
- **Decision**: Use BOTH - specific skill names internally, milestone language in UI
- **Rationale**: Internal names need precision (orchestrate-implementation). User-facing messages need clarity ("Your audio engine is working!"). Different contexts, different needs.

## Gap Analysis

### Areas Not Fully Covered
1. **Build system optimization** - Not analyzed for performance improvements
2. **Hook system efficiency** - Python validators could be optimized
3. **Git operations overhead** - Frequent commits may slow workflow
4. **Template generation** - Default UI/DSP templates not explored
5. **Cross-platform considerations** - Mac-focused, Windows/Linux not analyzed

### Recommendations for Future Analysis
1. Profile build times and optimize CMake configuration
2. Consider hook consolidation or native implementation
3. Implement smart git batching (commit after phase, not step)
4. Create template library for common plugin types
5. Test on Windows/Linux for platform-specific optimizations

### Edge Cases to Monitor
1. Complex plugins with 50+ parameters
2. Plugins requiring custom DSP architectures
3. Multi-format builds (VST3 + AU + Standalone)
4. Plugins with external dependencies
5. Resume scenarios after partial completion

---

## Implementation Notes

### Key Principles to Maintain
1. **Safety over speed for complex plugins** - Express mode is opt-in
2. **Reversibility** - All changes must be rollback-capable
3. **Progressive enhancement** - System remains functional during migration
4. **Backward compatibility** - Maintain aliases during transition
5. **Test coverage** - Each optimization requires validation suite

### Validation Checkpoints Between Phases
- **After Phase 1:** Full workflow test with parallelization
- **After Phase 2:** Express mode validation with 10 test plugins
- **After Phase 3:** Complete regression suite + user testing

### Rollback Strategy
1. **Git-based:** Each optimization in separate branch
2. **Feature flags:** Express mode, caching toggleable
3. **Gradual rollout:** Test with power users first
4. **Monitoring:** Track failure rates, completion times
5. **Quick revert:** <1 hour rollback capability

---

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk (Implement First)
- Milestone language (text only)
- Agent naming (internal only)
- Validation caching (deterministic)
- Stage merges (same operations)

### Medium Risk (Validate Thoroughly)
- Plugin-* removal (breaking changes)
- Validation subagent (comprehensiveness)
- State to subagents (handoff complexity)

### Mitigations
- Comprehensive test suite before each phase
- Feature flags for risky changes
- Parallel run (old + new) for validation
- User acceptance testing between phases
